									When Alice Springs mother of five Fiona O’Loughlin started doing stand-up later in life than most comics, 
									her hilarious stories of housewifery and motherhood were an immediate hit. 
									Her first festival show, for example – Fiona And Her Sister (And Some Weird Guy) earned her the 
									Best Newcomer Award at the 2001 Melbourne International Comedy Festival (MICF). She’s been enjoying 
									sell-out seasons on the festival circuit ever since. In 2006 she took home the Piece of Wood, 
									an MICF award for funniest show as voted for by other comics. In 2007 and 2008 she was nominated 
									for the MICF’s Barry Award for Best Show.
								</p>
								<p>
									Fiona has taken her story-based stand-up around the world, headlining LA’s world-renowned Improv Comedy Club, 
									playing repeat seasons in Hong Kong and performing at Edinburgh Fringe, Montreal’s invitation-only Just For Laughs 
									and the UK’s oldest, Leicester Comedy Festival.
								</p>
								<p>
									Fiona’s also been a hit on the telly with guest appearances on Sunrise, Good News Week, Spicks and Specks, 
									The Circle, Talkin Bout Your Generation, The World Stands Up, Celebrity Apprentice and a heap of Comedy Festival Galas.
								</p>
								<p>
									In more recent years Fiona has overcome a well-documented ‘battle with the bottle’. 
									This, like the other aspects of her life, has become ‘material’ for her stand-up. And Fiona is even funnier sober.
								</p>

									<strong><em>O’Loughlin has a gorgeous presence… Radioactively funny.</em>
