  				  		<p>"Knowledge in humour can help develop coping skills during tricky adolescent years. Overseas studies suggest that the use of humour in the classroom reduces tension, improves the classroom climate, increases enjoyment, aids student / teacher rapport and even helps learning. Humour can draw people together and reduce stress that can otherwise shut down the ability to learn."</p>
  				  		<p><em>- THE AGE - Comedy In Education cover story 26/03/2007</em></p>
  				  		<p>We offer 2 school programs that travel around Australia.</p>
  				  		<h3>1. COMEDY WRITING WORKSHOP</h3>
  				  		<p>The ability to find and write comedy is a greatly admired asset in any industry. Whether a student grows up to pursue a career in the corporate world where they must give presentations and speeches, or whether they choose a more artistic industry like creative writing or performance, the ability to add humour to one's work can make a person instantly more likable and their communicative abilities much more effective.</p>
  				  		<p>This intensive 3 hour in-school workshop hopes to energize and inspire students by demystifying the arts industry and presenting a range of arts-related professions as valid career options.</p>
  				  		<p>It aims to bring students out of their shells and teach them to value their individuality as a crucial tool for success. This workshop is helping students of all ages to discover comedy as a very effective means of communicating in any industry.</p>
  				  		<p>It is an intensive yet fun comedy writing workshop that provides students with all the necessary tools and formulas to draw and write comedy from their own real life experiences.</p>
  				  		
  				  		<h3>2. A COMEDIC GUIDE TO GETTING A JOB</h3>
  				  		<p>We team a comedian up with an experienced, corporate recruitment officer to form a comedic workshop that will provide memorable interview tips for senior students.</p>
